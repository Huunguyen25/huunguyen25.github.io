### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7]()

    * Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-huu-luis)

    * Lab 11, both part 1 and 2, were a few of the challenging, yet fun labs.
    I found lab 11 to be extremely fun because it introduced me to classes and
    initializer lists. It also introduced me to PRNG usage which was easy

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-huu-dylan-2)

    * Lab 12, part 1, and part 2 were some of the best labs I participated 
    in. It was one of the best because I worked on graphic manipulation 
    before with Java, but I have never combined gifs into one gif. From 
    this lab, I have learned the new Magick API.
