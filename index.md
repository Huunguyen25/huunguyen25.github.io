### CPSC 120

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-adrian-huu-2)

    * Lab 10, part 1 and 2 was about reading and using CSV files. I found this lab 
    helpful for the future when working with spreadsheets and any websites with data 
    in a spreadsheet manner. I found it helpful and practical when data and programming 
    together. I also understand the importance of scalability. As files grow, they are 
    straightforward to access and manage using code. Thus, I found this lab very helpful.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-huu-luis)

    * Lab 11, parts 1 and 2, were a few challenging yet fun labs. I found lab 11 
    to be extremely fun because it introduced me to classes and initializer lists. 
    It also introduced me to the usage of PRNG and the different algorithms used to 
    generate pseudo-random numbers.


* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-huu-dylan-2)

    * Lab 12, part 1, and part 2 were some of the best labs I participated 
    in. It was one of the best because I worked on graphic manipulation 
    before with Java, but I have never combined gifs into one gif. From 
    this lab, I have learned the new Magick API.
