# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Huu Nguyen and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

#### About me 
<img src="images/memoji_279x332.PNG" alt="drawing" width="150"/>
<p1>Hi, I'm Huu Nguyen! I was born and raised in Quang Ngai, Vietnam. When I was nine, my family and I moved to the United States for a better future.
I'm proud to say that I attended Patrick Henry High School, where I excelled academically. I'm a freshman at California State University of Fullerton, 
graduating in 2027. I'm an experienced computer programmer, having started as a junior in high school. My language is Java, and I am an intermediate-level coder at Java. Developing a Chat App based on my teacher's code was one of my most significant achievements. Though I didn't finish it, it was an outstanding project, and I'm very proud that I got to learn React, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and other services.</p1>

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-adrian-huu-2)

    * Lab 10, part 1 and 2 was about reading and using CSV files. I found this lab 
    helpful for the future when working with spreadsheets and any websites with data 
    in a spreadsheet manner. I found it helpful and practical when data and programming 
    together. I also understand the importance of scalability. As files grow, they are 
    straightforward to access and manage using code. Thus, I found this lab very helpful.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-huu-luis)

    * Lab 11, parts 1 and 2, were a few challenging yet fun labs. I found lab 11 
    to be extremely fun because it introduced me to classes and initializer lists. 
    It also introduced me to the usage of PRNG and the different algorithms used to 
    generate pseudo-random numbers.


* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-huu-dylan-2)

    * Lab 12, part 1, and part 2 were some of the best labs I participated 
    in. It was one of the best because I worked on graphic manipulation 
    before with Java, but I have never combined gifs into one gif. From 
    this lab, I have learned the new Magick API.
